# ðŸ“š MediaNexus

**MediaNexus** is a personal media tracker application currently in development. It aims to help users organize and track their media consumption, including anime, TV shows, novels, manga, and more. The project also serves as a learning environment for experimenting with different database architectures and building a modern WPF desktop interface.

- âž• Add, update, and delete entries from your personal media library
- ðŸ§© Support for custom, user-defined media types (stored locally)
- ðŸ§ª Test and compare different relational database systems:
  - PostgreSQL
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - SQLite
- ðŸ–¥ Build a clean and user-friendly desktop interface using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Practice SQL and relational database schema design
- Explore differences between SQL dialects (PostgreSQL vs SQL Server)
- Understand best practices for building maintainable applications using clean architecture and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Learn and apply WPF concepts including data binding and command-based UI interaction
- Implement the Repository Pattern for database architecture.
---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack (Planned)

- .NET (C#)
- WPF (UI Layer)
- ADO.NET or Entity Framework Core (Data Access Layer)
- PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite (for database experimentation)
- Serilog (for structured logging)
- Docker (for development database environments only)
- Eventual REST API for hosted server
